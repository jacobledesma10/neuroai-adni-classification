# Interpretable NeuroAI for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification (ADNI)

Project Overview

This project builds an **interpretable AI system** to classify Alzheimer’s disease stages using **multimodal data** from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).  
The goal is not only high predictive performance, but **clinical transparency**—identifying which **brain regions and clinical features** most influence model decisions.

> **Mission:** Apply AI and neuroscience to create trustworthy models that support research and ultimately improve human health.

Problem Statement

Alzheimer’s disease progression is heterogeneous and difficult to detect early.  
This project focuses on:

• Classifying subjects as:
  - CN (Cognitively Normal)  
  - MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)  
  - AD (Alzheimer’s Disease)

• Using both:
  - **MRI imaging data**
  - **Clinical + cognitive features**

• Emphasizing **interpretability** using explainable AI (XAI) methods.

Dataset

**Source:** Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)  
https://adni.loni.usc.edu

**Modalities Used**
• Structural T1-weighted MRI  
• Demographics (age, sex, education)  
• Cognitive scores (MMSE, CDR, ADAS-Cog)  
• Clinical diagnosis labels

Data access requires registration and approval from ADNI.
